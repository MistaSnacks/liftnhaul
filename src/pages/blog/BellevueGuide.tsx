            Bellevue, Washington's fifth-largest city, has transformed from a quiet suburban community into a thriving urban center. Known for its excellent schools, growing tech presence, and high quality of life, Bellevue offers a perfect blend of urban amenities and natural beauty. This comprehensive guide will help you understand what makes Bellevue special and what to expect when moving to this dynamic city.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Choose Bellevue?</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Bellevue consistently ranks among the best places to live in the United States, known for its excellent schools, safe neighborhoods, and strong economy. The city offers a more relaxed alternative to Seattle while maintaining easy access to big-city amenities. Its position as a tech hub, combined with outstanding public services and beautiful parks, makes it particularly attractive to professionals and families.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Location and Climate</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Located east of Seattle across Lake Washington, Bellevue enjoys a strategic position in the Puget Sound region. The city experiences a mild Pacific Northwest climate, with comfortable summers and cool winters. While the region sees regular rainfall, Bellevue actually receives less precipitation than Seattle due to the "rain shadow" effect of the Olympic Mountains.
