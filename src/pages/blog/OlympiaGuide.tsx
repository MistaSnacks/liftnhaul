          <p className="mb-6">
            Olympia stands out for its perfect balance of urban amenities and natural 
            surroundings. As the state capital, it offers stable government employment 
            opportunities while maintaining a relaxed, small-city atmosphere. The city's

          <p className="mb-6">
            Located at the southern end of Puget Sound, Olympia enjoys a mild maritime 
            climate with moderate temperatures year-round. While the region experiences 
            regular rainfall, it creates the lush, green environment that characterizes 
            the Pacific Northwest. The city's strategic location provides easy access to 
            major urban centers like Seattle and Portland, as well as natural attractions 
            including Mount Rainier and the Olympic Peninsula.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Housing Market Overview</h2>
          <p className="mb-6">
            Olympia's housing market offers diverse options at more affordable prices 
            compared to nearby Seattle. From historic homes in established neighborhoods 
            to modern developments in growing areas, the city provides housing choices 
            for various preferences and budgets. Popular neighborhoods include the 
            historic South Capitol area, the waterfront community of West Bay Drive,

          <p className="mb-6">
            As the state capital, government employment forms a significant portion of

            sector, particularly in healthcare, education, and professional services. 
            The stable government presence helps maintain economic stability, while 
            emerging industries provide diverse career opportunities for residents.
